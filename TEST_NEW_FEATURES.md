# 🧪 **Testing Guide for New Features**

## ✅ **TypeScript Compilation Issues FIXED**

The compilation errors in AdminDashboard.tsx and Reports.tsx have been resolved:
- Fixed `achievement_percentage` type conversion issues
- All parseFloat operations now use `.toString()` for type safety

## 🚀 **How to Test New Features:**

### **1. Profile Settings** (`/profile`)

**Steps to Test:**
1. Login as any user (admin or normal)
2. Click on your avatar in the top-right corner
3. Select "Profile Settings" from the dropdown menu
4. **Test Profile Update:**
   - Change your first name or last name
   - Click "Update Profile"
   - Verify success message appears
5. **Test Password Change:**
   - Enter current password
   - Enter new password (minimum 6 characters)
   - Confirm new password
   - Click "Change Password"
   - Verify success message appears

**Expected Behavior:**
- Form validation works in real-time
- Read-only fields show current role and outlet
- Success/error messages appear appropriately

### **2. Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`)

**Steps to Test:**
1. Login as admin user: `admin@99pancakes.com` / `admin123`
2. Click on your avatar → "Admin Dashboard"
3. **Verify Overview Cards:**
   - Active Outlets count
   - Total Users count  
   - MTD Revenue total
   - Average Achievement percentage
4. **Check Performance Table:**
   - All outlets listed with current month data
   - Achievement percentages color-coded (green ≥100%, orange <100%)
   - MTD targets vs actual sales
5. **View Outlets Management:**
   - All outlets listed with details
   - Manager names, phone numbers, status

**Expected Behavior:**
- Only accessible to admin users
- Real MTD data calculated from current month
- Color-coded achievement indicators
- All outlet information displayed correctly

### **3. Reports & Analytics** (`/reports`)

**Steps to Test:**
1. Login as any user
2. Click on your avatar → "Reports"
3. **Test Filtering:**
   - Change start/end dates
   - If admin: select different outlets or "All Outlets"
   - Click "Generate Report"
4. **Verify Charts:**
   - **Daily Sales Trend**: Line chart with sales vs targets
   - **Product Distribution**: Pie chart showing cakes vs pastries
   - **Outlet Comparison** (admin only): Bar chart with achievement %
5. **Check Data Table:**
   - Detailed sales records for selected period
   - Achievement percentages calculated correctly
   - All metrics displayed (APC, tickets, products sold)
6. **Verify Summary Cards:**
   - Total Revenue for period
   - Total Tickets processed
   - Average APC calculated
   - Total Products (cakes + pastries)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Charts render correctly and are responsive
- Date filtering works properly
- Normal users see only their outlet data
- Admin users can filter by outlet or see all
- Summary statistics update based on filters

## 🔍 **Navigation Testing:**

**Menu Access:**
1. Click on user avatar (top-right)
2. Verify menu items based on role:
   - **All Users**: Profile Settings, Reports, Logout
   - **Admin Users**: + Admin Dashboard

**Role-Based Access:**
- Normal users cannot access `/admin` route
- Admin users have full access to all features
- Navigation redirects work properly

## 📊 **Data Verification:**

**Check Real Data:**
- MTD calculations show current month totals
- Achievement percentages calculated as (actual/target) * 100
- APC calculated as net_sale / total_tickets
- Charts display last 30 days of data by default

## ⚠️ **Known Limitations:**

1. **User Management**: Framework is ready but create/edit operations need backend integration
2. **Outlet Management**: View-only at present, edit functionality ready for backend
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Basic charts implemented, more complex analytics can be added
